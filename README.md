# Hypothetical

This project was conceived as a way for me to get familiar with AngularJS 2, while also solving an argument
that I've had many times with friends.

Here in Lebanon, New Hampshire, people have the choice to live in either New Hampshire or Vermont. New Hampshire
has no income tax or sales tax. Vermont has a substantial income and sales tax, but often has lower property taxes
and car registration fees. Often times, rent is cheaper there, too.

So, which one is better? It surprised me to realize that unless you actually did the math, it was hard to know the
answer. There's just too many factors at play.

So, I made this website, where you can easily compare different taxes, expenses, and cash flows. 

It's currently at a very early version. With time, I want to make it much more complete. In particular, I want to
make it easy to calculate state taxes (with most tax tables pre-loaded), and to easily take into account real estate
and sales taxes.

I also want to make it possible to save, load, and share the results.

# Development

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.

It's an Angular 2 project, with Bootstrap 4 CSS and some light use of the ng2-bootstrap UI components.
 
# Getting Started

After cloning it, run:

`npm install`

and then

`npm serve --open`


## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.

`ng github-pages:deploy "Deploying to github pages for serving.`
